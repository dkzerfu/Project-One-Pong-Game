## How to build it 
1. We need to set up our html css and js files
2. Create canvas on html
3. on js add the html elements to the DOM 
4. On our canvas, when we go right, the x increase, and when we go towards the bottom, the y value increase.
5. The ball will be on the center everytime the game starts
# MVP checklist
* The players will see the score on their side of the screen
* If the players have 5 points, the player wins
* users be able to use the keys to move the block
* use matimatical equation for collition detection
